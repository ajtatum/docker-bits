# Ddclient is a Perl client used to update dynamic DNS entries for accounts on
# Dynamic DNS Network Service Provider. It was originally written by Paul Burry
# and is now mostly by wimpunk. It has the capability to update more than just
# dyndns and it can fetch your WAN-ipaddress in a few different ways.
