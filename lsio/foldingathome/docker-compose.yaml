# [Folding@home]({{ project_url }}) is a distributed computing project for
# simulating protein dynamics, including the process of protein folding and the
# movements of proteins implicated in a variety of diseases. It brings together
# citizen scientists who volunteer to run simulations of protein dynamics on
# their personal computers. Insights from this data are helping scientists to
# better understand biology, and providing new opportunities for developing
# therapeutics.
