# [WireGuardÂ®](https://www.wireguard.com/) is an extremely simple yet fast and
# modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster,
# simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive
# headache. It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN.
# WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded
# interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances.
# Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform (Windows,
# macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable. It is currently under heavy
# development, but already it might be regarded as the most secure, easiest to
# use, and simplest VPN solution in the industry.
